## [1.1.5] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- Version bump

## [1.1.4] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- Break nudge system: gentle break suggestions triggered by long sessions (90+ minutes) or high cognitive load (70+ score)
- Break warning popup: countdown window with "Start now", "+1 min", and "Skip" options before break overlay
- Break overlay: fullscreen glassmorphism overlay with blurred screenshot background, timer, and end-of-break survey
- Focus nudge system: context switching detection with focus session suggestions when switching exceeds personal baseline
- Focus nudge popup: notification-style popup suggesting focus sessions when excessive context switching is detected
- Focus timer: visual timer widget displayed in top-right corner and macOS menu bar during focus sessions
- Intelligent break pausing: breaks automatically pause during meetings, media consumption, or inactive periods
- System notifications: break and focus nudges trigger system notifications visible over fullscreen apps

### Changed
- Window management: improved window closing logic to handle duplicate windows and ensure proper cleanup
- Break overlay styling: enhanced glassmorphism effects with improved blur and transparency
- Focus timer display: shows remaining time in macOS menu bar tray icon

### Fixed
- Window closing issues: fixed stuck windows by ensuring all duplicate windows are destroyed
- Break overlay session end: improved session end logic to handle edge cases with missing session IDs
- Focus timer persistence: fixed timer remaining in tray after session cancellation

## [1.1.3] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- Display score transformation: read-time trend smoothing (R²-weighted sliding regression) and percentile-based remapping so the chart uses more of the 0–100 range
- User score percentiles (p10, p90, number_scores) from Supabase, computed every 12 hours; remapping blends in with confidence as data accumulates
- Display categories: low/mid/high thresholds set to 30/65 (tuned for remapped scores)

### Changed
- Chart and session bar colors now use 30/65 breakpoints; tooltip and circle card thresholds updated to match
- Tamed display amplification: target remap range 25–75 (was 15–85), blend strength 0.80 (was 0.65) to reduce wild swings while keeping trend emphasis

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- Extreme Z-score detection card on dashboard: when a behavioral metric hits |Z| ≥ 2.5, a top card appears with dynamic text ("Your [metric] is [direction].") and opens a quick check-in survey
- ZScoreSurveyModal: 3-question survey (focused, stressed, productive, 0–100) for extreme Z-score events; responses stored in cognitive_scores
- Server-side extreme Z-score detection in scoring utils with metric name mapping and direction labels
- PATCH `/api/scores/[id]/survey` endpoint to save Z-score survey responses (focused, stressed, productive)
- Scores API now returns `cognitive_score_id` and optional `extreme_zscore` when |Z| ≥ 2.5
- Rust: ExtremeZScoreAlert state, get/clear Tauri commands, and `extreme-zscore-alert` event
- Rust: Check for extreme Z-score on 5-minute boundaries after upload; 30% chance push notification when alert triggers
- Session notifications: 30% chance at 30-minute session mark; 70% chance when session ≥ 20 min and 4 consecutive inactive minutes
- Frontend: useExtremeZScoreAlert hook (polls + event listener), notifications utility, zscoreSurveyApi

### Changed
- WelcomeTourCard: shows tour card only when `opened_tutorial` is false; when tutorial is done, shows extreme Z-score card when an alert exists
- Minute logger: calls extreme Z-score check and session notification checks after successful uploads

### Fixed
- Rust E0597 in check_extreme_zscore: semicolon after if-let so MutexGuard is dropped before state
- ZScoreSurveyModal imports: use relative paths (../../utils, ../../hooks) instead of @ alias
