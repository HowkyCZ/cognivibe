// Utility types for window management and other utilities
// Currently no specific types needed, but this file is ready for future utility types

// Example: Window-related types could be added here if needed
// #[derive(Debug, Clone)]
// pub struct WindowState {
//     pub is_focused: bool,
//     pub is_minimized: bool,
// }
